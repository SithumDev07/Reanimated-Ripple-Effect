# Ripple Effect React Native Reanimated 2

In order to identifies the taps we need to use TapGestureHandler from react-native-gesture-handler

        <TapGestureHandler onGestureEvent={}>
            <View style={style}>
                {children}
            </View>
        </TapGestureHandler>

## Worklets

Javascript function that executes in UI thread.
